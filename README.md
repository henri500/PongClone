# PongClone
Pong game (2 players) made with Kivy

The main.py  file contains the main functionality of the game 
but the separate file (pong.kv) contains the UI design of the 
game and is  written in the kivy langauge (access kivy website for more details or contact me if you have any problem with the code i wrote.)
NOTE: keep both file in the same folder or the reference to the kv file will not work.
